Welcome to use Wingufile client.

Wingufile client is used to download a "library" from a Wingufile website, which is
different from other file sync service like dropbox.

1. Create a library on Wingufile website;

2. Download the library from Wingufile website;

3. Files added to this donwloaded library will automatically appear on Wingufile website.

Don't add files to the "Wingufile" folder. That would not make it appear on the website.
